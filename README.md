This is a work-in-progress ML project about Random Groups. I'd like to build a classifier that, based on several input parameters, attempts to categorise groups as either infinite hyperbolic or trivial. The goal is to produce a classifier that with high accuracy predicts the phase transition theorem associated to Gromov's density model, that is, for Gromov density $$d \in [0,1]$$, when $$d<0.5$$, the group is asymptotically almost surely infinite hyperbolic, and when $$d>0.5$$, the group is a.a.s. trivial.
